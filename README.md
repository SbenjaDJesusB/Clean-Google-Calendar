An interface for Google Calendar that makes it more straightforward and enjoyable to use.

The icon was generously made by [Sascha Mombartz](http://mombartz.com).

This was initially a Stylish user style but I liked it so I decided to package it into a Chrome app.

The app can be downloaded from the Chrome Web Store at [this link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/clean-google-calendar/magodclodecbbnbdfpmoehfdddkhlfmm).

If you've found a bug or would like for me to work on a feature please don't hesitate to message me.
